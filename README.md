From Odin Project:

This is my first "real" html project. here we go
start 11/10/17

Finished "google homepage".  Pretty basic stuff.  Reading about everything was good, but actually putting it into practice by making this page helped to solidify the concepts.  Biggest struggle was getting the footer to stop halfway up the page like the real google homepage does.  That one took several days of tinkering/thinking but it finally clicked that I could limit the min size of the actual webpage, not just viewing window.

finished: 12/12/17

total hours (very rough estimate): 15
